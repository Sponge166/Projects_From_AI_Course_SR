dogs evolved as hunters that consume prey that contains high amounts of protein, moderate amounts of fat, and a minimal amount of carbohydrates, and their diet still requires these general proportions today. dogs also require more than a dozen other nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and amino acids. Although your dog needs certain amounts of each specific nutrient to be healthy, more is not always better. This is particularly true of vitamins and minerals, so the use of supplements is usually not necessary if you are feeding a balanced and complete diet. Supplements can be harmful to your cat, and they should never be given without a veterinarianâ€™s approval. Cats should have access to clean, fresh water at all times.
