It is common, even when the dog is on a commercial diet that folks still like to feed treats or table scraps Wakshlag says. Treats should be limited to no more than 15% of the daily calorie intake since these are often not complete and balanced foods, which may throw off nutrient intake.  Many veterinary nutritionists recommend limiting your dogâ€™s calories from treats to 10% of their total diet, especially if you are working on a weight-loss program. Even though many of us feel like we only give our dogs occasional table scraps, those bites add up quickly.
