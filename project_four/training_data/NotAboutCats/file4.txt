Right now it seems like there’s a big disagreement going on as to whether or not the economy is doing well. The media mostly seems to emphasize that the economy is strong, while polls suggest that the vast majority of people think it’s bad and will continue to get worse before getting better.

At this point it’s also hard to ignore that in my browsing, there seems to be a very clear disconnect between left and right leaning communities. The obvious explanation for this is that a lot of people are anxious that Biden won’t win and are looking to emphasize things that will make him look good, while conservatives are eager to use people’s economic anxiety against Biden with the election next year.

So all that said, do you think the economy is doing well right now?
