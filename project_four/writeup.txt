After reading through the provided reading on Naive Bayes Classifiers I knew some of the reqierments of my personal implementation.

I would be working with blocks of text classified on the presense of a few specific words relating to cats like (cat, kitten, cats, feline, etc.)

The example in the reading had ordered data where as in my case the data is unordered. (i.e. it does not matter where "cat" shows up in a block of text for it to be about cats)

I also knew I could not possibly train on all words so I would have a lot of instances where im trying to classify a block of text containing words my Classifier had never seen before. To address this I used m-estiamtes to estimate P(x|Classification) such that x is a word unseen by our Classifier.

To classify your own text run
py main.py [file_name]

note: on your machine py may not work, also try python and python3
